Twitter-Front-End
=================

This is our 6th weekend challenge and is a front-end challenge that involves attempting to recreate the Twitter.com feed page.  The aim is to replicate the structure, HTML, CSS, and JS files rather than the back-end functionality.  Semantic HTML5 tags should be deployed and the focus is on rendering the page for desktop users at this stage.  My final version is [published on Heroku here.](https://bentwittermakers.herokuapp.com/)

###Core features that should be integrated:
- A fixed, floating header that remains in place as you scroll the page
- Infinite scrolling via Javascript that pulls in additional dummy data as you near the end of the page
- A spinner graphic during an emulated delay as data is "loaded" during an infinite scroll
- The tweet input box should expand when in focus

###Technologies I Will Explore
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- I am selectively deploying fonts such as Glyphicons, Rosetta Icons, and Font Awesome
- jScroll for infinity-scrolling

###Where I Would Like To Learn More
- Mobile First
- More Responsive CSS
- More jQuery

###Core Twitter Brand Assets & Colours
- Twitter actually publishes its official brand assets, colour-scheme, and typography information [here](https://about.twitter.com/press/brand-assets).  I am choosing to mirror the design of my personal Twitter account.
