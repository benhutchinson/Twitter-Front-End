Twitter-Front-End
=================

This is our 6th weekend challenge and is a front-end challenge that involves attempting to recreate the Twitter.com feed page.  The aim is to replicate the structure, HTML, CSS, and JS files rather than the back-end functionality.  Semantic HTML5 tags should be deployed and the focus is on rendering the page for desktop users at this stage.  

###Core features that should be integrated:

- A fixed, floating header that remains in place as you scroll the page
- Infinite scrolling via Javascript that pulls in additional dummy data as you near the end of the page
- A spinner graphic during an emulated delay as data is "loaded" during an infinite scroll
- The tweet input box should expand when in focus
- More responsive functionality vs Twitter's existing features that include resizing the search box and hiding labels in the navigation bar

###Technologies I Will Explore
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- I will use this task to learn about Bootstrap
- I am selectively deploying fonts such as Glyphicons, Rosetta Icons, and Font Awesome

###Core Twitter Brand Assets & Colours

- Twitter publishes its official brand assets, colour-scheme, and typography information [here](https://about.twitter.com/press/brand-assets)
